            <h3> Facts</h3>
            <p> Mark Hughes once played for Wales and Bayern Munich in the same day
                    Hughes had just signed for Bayern and was due to play for Wales against Czechoslovakia in Prague in a Euro ’88 qualifier. “I had dinner with Uli Hoeness who asked me what time the Wales match was,” he said. “I told him it was around midday and he said: ‘That’s OK then, you can play in the evening as well.'” Hoeness watched the game and then flew him to the Bayern game on the other side of the Czech border where Borussia Monchengladbach were the opponents. “We actually flew over the ground and missed the first half, but I got there at the start of the second half.” Bayern won.

                    Alvin Martin once scored a hat-trick against three different goalkeepers
                    The defender achieved the feat playing for West Ham against Newcastle in 1986. His first goal came against Martin Thomas, who was an actual keeper, but was forced off with injury. Martin then scored against defender Chris Hedworth, who also injured himself meaning Peter Beardsley was next. The Hammers won 8-1.

                    Clive Allen ended the 1979/80 season at QPR and began the following campaign at Palace, after Arsenal had made him the costliest teenager in football during the summer
                    Having scored 28 goals for QPR in the Second Division, Arsenal paid £1.25m for Allen, but he played three pre-season friendlies before being moved on to Selhurst Park. He later joined Tottenham in 1984 and enjoyed huge success including scoring 49 goals in one season.

                    Since 1982 at least one Bayern player has been in the starting line-up in every World Cup final
                    It’s true. Germany appeared in the 1982, ’86, ’90, ’02 and 2014 finals, while players such as Jorginho (Brazil in ’94), Bixente Lizarazu (France in ’98), Willy Sagnol (France ’06) and Arjen Robben (Netherlands ’10) have starred.

                    Before Alex Ferguson took over at Manchester United, Aston Villa were more successful than the Red Devils
                    Yes, Fergie took over in 1986 at which point Villa had won seven league titles and FA Cups, three League Cups and the European Cup. United, meanwhile had also won seven titles, but six FA Cups, a European Cup and Cup Winners Cup. That’s 18-15 in terms of major honours won.
